            I went to undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University, intending to double major in physics and philosophy, I eventually got
            too hooked on math and switched to physics and mathematics, specializing in astrophysics.<br><br>
            
            Inspired by my undergrad research in Galactic Dynamics with 
            <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/walker.html">Dr. Matthew Walker</a> 
            and my summer research experience for
            undergraduates (REU) in Cosmology with 
            <a href="https://www.lloydknox.com/">Dr. Lloyd Knox</a>, I applied to graduate school in astrophysics. Before I started
            the PhD program in the Princeton Astrophysics Department, I completed 
            <a href="https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/students/undergrad/part_iii"> Part III</a> of the Mathematical Tripos at the
            Institute of Astronomy (IoA) at Cambridge University in England. While in Cambridge I did research with 
            <a href="https://people.ast.cam.ac.uk/~vasily/">Dr. Vasily Belokurov</a> 
            and <a href="https://people.ast.cam.ac.uk/~nwe/">Dr. Wyn Evans</a> on the structure of the Milky Wayâ€™s Stellar Halo.<br><br>
            
            Since starting my PhD at Princeton in 2017 I have worked on a large variety of topics in Astrophysics. My work under 
            <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/david-spergel/">Dr. David Spergel</a> has caused me to travel often to the 
            <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/">Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA)</a>
            where I have also collaborated with many other researchers. I have also worked closely with 
            <a href="https://crispygreene.wixsite.com/jenny">Dr. Jenny Greene</a> on observational projects
            related to Intermediate Mass Black Holes.<br><br>
            
            In 2019 I started my thesis work with <a href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~eco/">Dr. Eve Ostriker</a>, 
            though I also work closely with 
            <a href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~cgkim/astral/index.html#">Dr. Chang-Goo Kim</a> and 
            <a href="https://jeonggyukim.github.io/page/about/">Dr. Jeong-Gyu Kim</a>.
            The main guiding goal of my thesis, and my planned future work, is to try to understand the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD),
            stellar dynamic, and feedback processes involved in star formation in dense environments. I am particularly interested
            in the outstanding problem of 
            <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ARA%26A..56...83B/abstract">Multiple Populations in Globular Star Clusters</a>, 
            and how feedback from forming stars can
            act to chemically enrich gas that subsequently forms more stars, creating chemically distinct but co-natal populations.
            In order to tackle this larger goal, I have found that we must first form a much better understanding of how winds from
            massive stars interact with the dense environments in which these stars form. The improved understanding of stellar wind
            feedback given by my thesis work has also allowed us to have a much better understanding of star-formation works in
            normal star forming environments (in our own Milky Way) as well as in forming Super Star Clusters (the closest we can
            get to an observable version of a forming Globular Cluster).
