##  Wandering Black Holes in the Milky Way

Working with [Dr. Jenny Greene](https://crispygreene.wixsite.com/jenny) and a slew of other talented collaborators, we set out to try to find "wandering" Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) that used to live at the center of dense star clusters that have since disrupted in the potential of our Milky Way Galaxy.  Past works had postulated that such wandering IMBHs would retain several stars in their gravitational influence, remaining tightly bound around them in what would appear to be an extremely dense star cluster.

In [our work](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917...17G/abstract) we set out to find these objects by looking for statistical over-densities of stars on the sky. The astrometric precision of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Gaia satellite allowed us to look for these over-densities on sub-arcsecond spatial scales. My main contribution to this work was dealing with the Gaia data (and supplemenetary data curated by [Dr. Sergey Koposov](https://www.roe.ac.uk/~skoposov/)) and creating a statistical model for what counted as an over-density on the sky. Once we had a list of candidate IMBH star clusters, we used deep DECaLS to validate these candidates, since we would expect deeper data to reveal many more stars than the Gaia data if these were real star clusters.

Unfortunately, we were not able to find any IMBH star clusters, but we were able to place great limits on how many of them there are in the Milky Way.

Our previous search for these objects as overly-bright, unresolved point sources in spectroscopic surveys actually resulted in our discovery of the Symbiotic Nova [CN Cha](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..125L/abstract).
